> Dataset for feathers classification

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2004.08606-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.08606)

The FeathersV1 Dataset contains 28,272 feather images of the web-nature. The images are collected from feather forums, public websites, and search engines.

Dataset is organized in simplified taxonomic order consisting of two layers, namely Order and Species.

Each image contains cropped image of single feather of bird, sometimes with part of adjacent feathers of the same species.

## Usage

This repository contains the following folders:

* data - contains the classes of images files in CSV format;
* images - contains image data in JPG format, split by subdirectories of Order and Species.

CSV files contains rows of the `filename`, `order` and `species` for each image.

We offer ready-made "frozen" CSV partitions for Species in variations:

* All species images;
* Top-50 species by the number of occurrences of images in the species classes;
* Top-100 species by the number of occurrences of images in the species classes;

*In each case the data was shuffled and split by 80-20 for train and test.*
